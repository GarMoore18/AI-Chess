# Minimax and Alpha-beta Pruning for Chess
Created a chess game where the AI controls both players. Minimax and alpha-beta pruning were implemented to control the AI. The goal of the project was to visualize the speed and depth increase that alpha-beta pruning provides.

# Description
    A chess game that is played between two AI players. The AI players
    can use minimax or alpha-beta pruning to decide which move to make.
    The implementation of the two algorithms was used to demonstrate
    the speed and depth increase that alpha-beta pruning would provide.

# Prerequisites
    Pygame

# Examples
    Run the run_game.py file
    - The file provides four base options to choose from.
        - Test 1 utilizes minimax
        - Test 2 utilizes alpha-beta pruning
        - Test 3 utilizes alpha-beta pruning with more depth
        - Test 4 provides invalid parameters with raised errors
